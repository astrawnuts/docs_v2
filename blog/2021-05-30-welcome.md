We are very pleased to announce the launch of Help Desk. Help desk is an online app that allows users to gain more knowledge about all things accounting in the world of Tax Matterz. Want to learn about how to pay your taxes online, what is GST, how to decode your transaction etc,  well you can learn this and more on Help Desk.
Help Desk has been made in house powered by love and the latest in web technologies and officially launched on 29 December 2022. The journey to creating this app started nearly one to two years back.

Our Process:
* Researching various online platforms that supported all of the features we required.
* Exploring each of the platforms that we shortlisted.
* Designing the User Interface on top of our selected platform.
* Writing the documentation and various articles.
* Launch

Our vision for Help Desk is to continuously ship new features and articles to make our clients lives that much easier.

It is available for all modern mobile phones and computers. If you bought your computer in the last 10 years, or smartphone in the last 5-6 years Help Desk should work on your device. We recommend using a modern web browser such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Microsoft Edge. We donâ€™t test Help Desk on other browsers.

If you want an app like Help Desk or something else entirely to be made for you then speak to our lovely team and we will be sure to assist you.
