# How To Decode Your Bank Transactions? ðŸ’³

Decoding means that you should explain what each bank transaction is meant for.

Please decode your bank transactions whenever you are exporting them into an excel spreadsheet.
Write a small description explaining what each transaction is for in the first blank column in the far right of the spreadsheet. Example shown below.

### I'm using an Apple macOS Computer/Apple Numbers
* If you are using macOS and Apple Numbers then please make sure that the file you send to us is saved as an excel or csv file format (.xlsx, .xls or .csv). We are unable to open .numbers file formats.

For example for an income transaction which you have received money you can simply write income on the very last blank column (to the right) of the excel sheet
For rent, insurance, power, petrol you can write rent, insurance, power, or petrol respectively.
Another example is if the transaction is for personal purposes then simply write personal.
