### Steps 📃

***Note:*** In most cases it is best to pay through the website of your banking provider rather than using the mobile banking application (app). This is because features are usually built first for the website then implemented in the mobile banking app. 

1. Open your web browser of choice e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge etc.
2. Visit your bank's website and sign in to your internet banking.
3. Please select pay tax from the pay and transfer. It could be listed under Payments as IRD Payments or ask your bank. *For ASB you will need to first select "Make a payment" then "IRD Payment" from the list of options.* 
4. Please select (INC) “Income Tax or Provisional Tax” from the dropdown list of pay tax for the tax type
5. Please enter either your personal or company IRD number in the IRD number column.
6. Please enter <GetIncTaxPeriods YearEndOnly /> for the tax period (or pick the year that relates to your payment).
7. Please enter the amount you are paying for that period (note that you can make multiple part payments towards your total tax within the due date).
