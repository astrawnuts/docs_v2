### Steps 📃

***Note:*** In most cases it is best to pay using through the website of your banking provider rather than using the mobile application (app) for your bank. Usually features are built first for the website then implemented in the mobile banking app. 

1. Sign in to your internet banking.
2. Please select pay tax from the pay and transfer. It could be listed under Payments as IRD Payments or ask your bank.
3. Please select (INC) “Income Tax or Provisional Tax” from the dropdown list of pay tax for the tax type
4. Please enter either your personal or company IRD number in the IRD number column.
5. Please enter <GetIncTaxPeriods YearEndOnly /> for the tax period (or pick the year that relates to your payment).
6. Please enter the amount you are paying for that period (note that you can make multiple part payments towards your total tax within the due date).
