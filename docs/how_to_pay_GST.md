### Steps 📃

***Note:*** In most cases it is best to pay through the website of your banking provider rather than using the mobile banking application (app). This is because features are usually built first for the website then implemented in the mobile banking app. 

1. Open your web browser of choice e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge etc.
2. Visit your bank's website and sign in to your internet banking.
3. Please select pay tax from the pay and transfer. It could be listed under Payments as IRD Payments or ask your bank. *For ASB you will need to first select "Make a payment" then "IRD Payment" from the list of options.* 
4. Please select (GST) “Goods and Services Tax” from the dropdown list of pay tax for the tax type
5. Please enter either your personal or company GST number in the IRD number column. It’s the same as your personal or company IRD number.
6. Please enter <GetGSTPeriods /> (six-monthly) for the tax period (or pick the period that relates to your payment). Due dates are 28-10-2021 *(1st Half March 2022)* and 07-05-2022 *(2nd Half March 2022)* respectively for the above periods.
7. Please enter the amount you are paying for that period (note that you can make multiple part payments towards your total GST within the due date).
